# circom-ethereum-opcodes

Circom circuit set of the Ethereum opcodes

## Goal

Tokamak team is working toward a zk-EVM which is capable to execute EVM bytecode and generate a zk-SNARK proof based on our SNARK paper "[An Efficient SNARK for Field-Programmable and RAM Circuits
](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/507)".
The original Groth16 requires high cost "setup" for every single transaction since it is a circuit-speicific SNARK. On the other hand, universal SNARKs such as Plonk would be enough with just a single setup but the existing protocols cause humongous computation overhead in proving and verifying algorithm.

Every transaction might execute different functions with different arguments but all the execution steps can be broken down into the EVM opcode set; the executed opcodes should be in the EVM instruction set even though the order of opcode execution would be different.

Our approach is to take advantage of those two different types of SNARK protocols by assembling each EVM opcode circuit in the order of executions by a transaction; it would be fast to prove and verify like circuit-speicific SNARKs and require only a single setup phase similar to universal SNARKs. It is enough to make setups for the EVM opcode circuits, rather than you need setups everytime transaction occurs. This allows us to make all transactions zk-provable after a single of the setup phase, using [Tokamak-ZkEVM](https://github.com/tokamak-network/Tokamak-ZkEVM) without any huge sacrifice in terms of cost to prove or verify.

This repository aims to implement zk-SNARK provable circuits of the EVM instruction set along Tokamak zk-EVM plan.

- `templates`: The set of circuits and functions frequently used by the sub-circuits. The circuits under `128bit` assume to take 128-bit length values.

## Circuit design

The circuits are implemented following the instruction definitions in Ethereum yellow paper.

To learn more about Circom, please check [the official document](https://docs.circom.io/).

### Input

The circuits take one or multiple input signals such as "`in1`" or "`in2`".

Due to limitation where the Circom's finite field prime (BN128) is 254-bit sized value, each circuit takes two 128-bit length values to be compatible with 32-byte words.

Signed integers are represented as two's complements.

### Output

All the opcode circuits return a single output except `load` for a special use.

The circuits returns two 128-bit values as output signals.

*: Improvement is required to be used in products.

Most Cost is the range check cost. For future research on optimization, please check [Further Research](#further-research) below.

### Our SNARK Primitive - Subcircuit library
Refer to [our SNARK paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/507.pdf) "3 Front-end preprocess: System of constraints and setup algorithm"

### Our Limitation
- EXP

    As the exponent range is [0,2**256), if an EXP circuit is implemented, it will be the most expensive among the above opcodes. In other words, including an EXP single circuit in the subcircuit library has the disadvantage of being expensive. One good approach is to implement the EXP operation using the MUL opcode circuit already in the subcircuit library.

- SHA3

    [Keccak256](https://github.com/vocdoni/keccak256-circom) hash function is implemented in Circom by [Vocdoni](https://github.com/vocdoni). However, it needs around 151k constraints by Keccak's zk-unfriendliness. It is too expensive to put it in a subcircuit library.
